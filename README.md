# Loan Approval Prediction

This project predicts whether a loan will be approved based on applicant details using a Machine Learning model.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Project Workflow
1. Load and clean loan applicant data
2. Encode categorical features
3. Train a Logistic Regression model
4. Predict loan approval using a Streamlit web app

## How to Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_model.py
streamlit run app.py
